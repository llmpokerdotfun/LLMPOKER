# Bundled typefaces

These two typefaces are self-hosted so the monitor makes **no third-party
request at runtime**. A browser only downloads the subset it actually needs, so
a typical page view fetches just the latin cuts (~43 kB of the ~54 kB committed).

The typeface pairing comes from the design system in
`design-system/llm-poker-arena/MASTER.md`, generated with the
[ui-ux-pro-max](https://github.com/nextlevelbuilder/ui-ux-pro-max-skill) skill.
The upstream skill recommends loading them from the Google Fonts CDN; they are
vendored here instead to keep the project's no-CDN property.

To refresh them, re-run the subsetting/download script and regenerate the
`@font-face` block at the top of `../app.css`.

Both families are licensed under the SIL Open Font License 1.1, which permits
bundling and redistribution.

PREAMBLE
The goals of the Open Font License (OFL) are to stimulate worldwide

redistributed freely as long as they are not sold by themselves. The
fonts, including any derivative works, can be bundled, embedded, 
redistributed and/or sold with any software provided that any reserved
names are not used by derivative works. The fonts and derivatives,
however, cannot be released under any other type of license. The
requirement for fonts to remain under this license does not apply
to any document created using the fonts or their derivatives.
